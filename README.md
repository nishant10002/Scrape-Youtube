Analysing and Visualizing data on Youtube using Youtube data API

This solo Python Project aims to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API to extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Simple visualization for this data is produced using the Python Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

In the first half of this project I aim to compare different youtube channels. I extract their details such as youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. I gather these details for 5 different channels and then compare these channel's data with each other. The aim is to see who has the highest subscribers, who gets the most views and the most amount of videos posted among these channels. I will be loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. Then I will also generate some basic visualization using this data so we can easily compare multiple channels.
